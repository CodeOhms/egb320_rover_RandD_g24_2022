# DietPi-Backup include/exclude filter

# Prefix "-" exclude items, "+" include items which would match a wildcard exclude rule.
# Suffix "/" match directories only, no files or symlinks.
# Using wildcard "*" matches any item name or part of it.
# Since the list is processed from top to bottom and the first match defines the result,
#   includes need to be defined before their wildcard exclude rule
#   and in case excludes before their wildcard include rule.
# Symlinks are handled as such and never processed recursively.
# Excluded directories are not processed recursively, so contained items cannot be included.
# Hence, to include items within an excluded directory:
# - Do not exclude the directory itself, but contained items via wildcard.
# - Define includes first, to override the wildcard exclude rule.
# - See the below default rules, how we exclude all items below /mnt
#   but include the dietpi_userdata directory, if it is no symlink.
# To prevent loops, the backup target dir, log and config are excluded internally.
